#hashbang line, tells the script it should use bash to interpret its content


# Script by Dominic Egger 03/14/2020
# Last update: 04/20/2020
# this script is designed to create an in situ .pbs file from a given .com input file and submit the job automatically to the MSI

# INSTRUCTIONS
# in order to use this script, create a folder called bin in your home directory via cd; mkdir bin; and save this script in the bin folder
# Then change the permissions of the script by typing in the bin directory "chmod 750 subg"
# Two methods to run script from any directory: 
# 1) call the script by typing "~/bin/subg filename.com" replacing filename as needed
# 2) edit your .bash_profile file (on MSI this seems to be identical with the .bashrc) by adding the following line
# export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
# this will allow you to source the script from anywhere you currently are in your folder tree
# to call this script type: source subg <name_of_.com_file>

# a .pbs file will be created automatically and submitted to the designated queue. The .pbs file will later be removed. If you want to keep your .pbs file
# then comment the function call tabula_rasa in the main function by adding a # in front of it
# Update History
# Dominic Egger 03/16/2020 original
# Connor Frye 03/27/2020 removed tilde from shebang to allow for method 1 of access, added chmod instructions
# Dominic Egger 03/31/2020 the instructions to edit your .bashrc were wrong - thanks Yukun for pointing this out to me - it should be export PATH=~/bin:$PATH   colon instead of =!
# Dominic Egger 04/06/2020 added the part of the get_par function that also allows the user to enter a designated amount of processors to be used
# Dominic Egger 04/20/2020 added the joblog function, which will create a file called joblog.txt in your home directory with a log of jobs you submitted
# Connor Frye 04/20/2020 for personal version, changed email settings and removed jokes function
# Connor Frye 04/21/2020 for personal version, changed joblog to store path rather than only file name
